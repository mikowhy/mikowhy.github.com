# 🙋 ‍🙋‍ ️Hello World! 🙋 ‍🙋‍

## My name is Mikolaj Paczkowski. 

I am a person who is constantly trying to find `fulfilment` in life by following my dreams and `values` such a honesty, truthfulness and transparency.

I try to spread these values amongst my colleagues and co-workers. I love people (especially my wife Ania), the sun, warm countries (especially Bulgaria, Cyprus) and my cat. Looking for meaningfulness in life is one of my main goals.

I have been in the business of broadly understood `e-commerce` and `Internet marketing` for 14 years now. This is how I managed to transpose the theoretical knowledge gained during my studies in IT into practical experience online.

Being a radio DJ with a philosophical twist is my passion and I have also spent half of my life working at various bars.
